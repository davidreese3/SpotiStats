# SpotiStats

One of my favorite parts of the year is Spotify Wrapped. Because I am a nerd who is into statistics and data, I am always left wanting more. This project is meant to satisfy that desire and allow me to gain more experience with Python using pandas DataFrames.

## Project Overview

Currently, this is a work in progress. I am still brainstorming more calculations to run. Currently, I'm using Matplotlib to generate visualizations. In the future, I plan to explore exporting the results as a full report, either as a PDF or an HTML page.


## Contributing

I am always open to suggestions for new statistics to compute! If you have ideas, feel free to reach out.
